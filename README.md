# HACKATHON
## RTS for the big touch screen in Shilling
### Technology

### Running this project
We have a modded manjaro ISO that launches the program on launch. This works really well.
Install community/allegro *(manjaro package)* then run the executable.

```bash
sudo pacman -S yay; sudo pacman -S allegro; ./rts
```
